## Varian challenge - 3D tumor detection in VR 

We made a solution that gives an excellent opportunity for doctors. Our aim was to support their fight against cancer and make their job more efficient. They can examine the MR records which are waiting for them in an already preprocessed status. To give them a brand new and innovative work experience we ported their workspace into the Virtual Reality. We wanted to give them the everything which is needed to succeed, one of the biggest advantage of this virtual workspace that they can see much more from the patients medical record. They can examine the brain in 3D , and investigate that directly. But these things worth nothing unless they find the tumor. Therefore we also provide a selecting service that reduce the number of the slices which are needed to be examined, so the work can be more accurate and efficient. To achieve this goal we applied different kind of filters, data science techniques and image processing.
